# To tell the program to make a title in the LaTeX file
# Set UseCustomTitle to True (set to False to not)
#
# Then use CustomTitleMarker to tell the program what will
# indicate that a new title should begin (it will not actually
# write down what this line is though). Enter it exactly
# without any extra quotation marks.
#
# Use CustomTitleLines to tell the program how many lines
# after the marker to consider as part of the title. The
# default is one line.
#
# FirstTitleFirstLine is whether to use the first line of the
# file as the first title
#
# ExtraNewline and ExtraSpace are for things like matrices
# and cases. You define what these are yourself - they are
# not present in actual, official Braille.
#
# They are the same for all extra, user-defined things.
